## Goals
  Accessibility
    Web Design
      Screenreaders[^1]
        Screen reader users hear every UI element read aloud. The shorter the text, the faster a screen reader user can navigate it.
        ex "Search vs search field": Usually the control type should not be stated because the ARIA label will announce the control type for screen reader users, making the extra label redundant.
        Image Alt Text
          Without using the words, “picture of” or “image of.”
          Lengthy descriptions in alt text may get truncated. Most screen readers do not read more than 125 characters of text.
          For long descriptions, use captions instead of alt text since they are available to all users and alt text is limited to 125 characters
          Screen readers are unable to read text that is embedded in imagery. If there is essential information embedded as text in the image, include the essential information in the alt text.
